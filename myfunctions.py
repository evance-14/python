# a function is a block of code that only works when it is called.
#you can pass data known as parameters into a function.

#def add(x,y):
    #return x + y

#x = 2
#y = 5

#z = add(x,y)
#print(z)

def average(x,y):
    return (x+y)/2

#next we creata new function file testaverage.py where we can use the above average function.
